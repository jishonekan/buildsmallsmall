# Netlify Redirects
# https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/

# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Netlify does this automatically, but explicit is fine)
# /   /   301!

# Handle Next.js routing for SPA-like behavior (if using static export, but Next.js plugin handles this usually)
# For standard Next.js on Netlify, you typically rely on the plugin. 
# However, manual redirects can be added here.

# Example: Redirect old paths to new ones
# /old-path   /new-path   301

# Allow Next.js to handle all other routes
# /*  /index.html  200
